# smart-garden

In this project, we collect sensor data (soil moisture and light intensity) from an plant pot using Arduino. 

The data is streamed to a Raspberry Pi device that collects and stores the data locally. The Raspi also connects to Azure for cloud storage. 

The project is ongoing and will be updated periodically.
